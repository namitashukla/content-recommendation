CIS 520 Final Project: by Namita Shukla, Bhumika Singhal, Riya Dholakia
Recommender system, an upcoming content filtering technology is widely used on websites, tamed according to the interest of users, and has varied applications in media services such as movies, music, venue, books, research articles, and social media in general. One of the potent personalization technologies powering the adaptive web is collaborative filtering (CF). In our work, we perform a comparison between different CF algorithms to assess their performance. We use item-based mean imputation as our baseline and further, we evaluated K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Soft KNN, item baseline KNN, Matrix Factorization, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Neural-based Recommender Systems. In our experiments, we used a popular Jester Joke dataset and clustered the items based on three similarity metrics - manhattan, cosine, and Pearson Correlation similarities. Our results reveal that the Ensemble of NMF and Soft KNN with item baseline (with Pearson Similarity) for item-based CF outperformed all other algorithms examined in this project.
